# The Netflix Challenge

## Introduction
Netflix launched a challenge where they gave $1,000,000 to any team that can beat their recommendation algorithm. More info here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize.
Here, I tried to build an algorithm that can predict movie ratings. For this project, I built a fully connected neural network.

## The Data
The dataset had 5,000 movies and over 470,000 users. More than 98% of the data was missing because most users have not watched most movies. 

## Report
The full report is also published here in the repository. 

## Results
I achieved an RMSE of 1.15
